This repository is dedicated to providing from-first-principles implementations
of one-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), as well as Tukey's Honest 
Significant Difference (HSD) test. This resource is particularly suited for 
graduate and advanced undergraduate students engaged in programs with a strong
emphasis on computational statistics, as well as industry practitioners with a
focus on the computational aspects of statistical analysis.

The LinkedIn articles cited below, along with the website(`https://vadimtyuryaev.github.io/ANOVA/`), cover the following topics in depth:

- **One-Way ANOVA**: Exploration of its assumptions, the rationale underpinning 
its methodology, implementation from first principles, and an illustrative examples.

- **Two-Way ANOVA with Interaction**: A comprehensive implementation of a two-way 
ANOVA model including an interaction term, accompanied by a practical example.

- **Type I Error in Multiple Mean Comparisons**: Investigation of Type I error rates 
in the context of multiple comparisons, supported by computational examples.

- **Tukey's HSD Test**: A conceptual overview and from-scratch implementation of
Tukey's HSD test, along with a practical demonstration.

- **Supplementary Visualizations**: A collection of bonus visualization scripts
to support exploratory data analysis (EDA) preceding the ANOVA procedures.
