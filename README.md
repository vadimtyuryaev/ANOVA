This repository is dedicated to providing from-first-principles
implementations of one-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), as
well as Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test. This resource
is particularly suited for graduate and advanced undergraduate students
engaged in programs with a strong emphasis on computational statistics,
as well as industry practitioners with a focus on the computational
aspects of statistical analysis.

The LinkedIn articles cited below, along with the repository, cover the
following topics:

- **One-Way ANOVA**: Exploration of its assumptions, the rationale
  underpinning its methodology, implementation from first principles,
  and an illustrative examples.

- **Two-Way ANOVA with Interaction**: A comprehensive implementation of
  a two-way ANOVA model including an interaction term, accompanied by a
  practical example.

- **Type I Error in Multiple Mean Comparisons**: Investigation of Type I
  error rates in the context of multiple comparisons, supported by
  computational examples.

- **Tukey’s HSD Test**: A conceptual overview and from-scratch
  implementation of Tukey’s HSD test, along with a practical
  demonstration.

- **Supplementary Visualizations**: A collection of bonus visualization
  scripts to support exploratory data analysis (EDA) preceding the ANOVA
  procedures.
